# CFDiscord

A simple Spigot/Paper plugin used for connecting a discord server with a minecraft server

Features in development:

- Connect your Discord profile to your Minecraft profile
- Run commands on the server (If you have the permissions ingame!)
- More to come

**This plugin is still in development and not usable yet!**

### Installation

Download/Build the jar and put it into your plugins folder.
Then set up a discord bot [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).
Enter that token id in the generated config.json inside the CFDiscord folder under plugins.

### Libraries

CFDiscord uses these libraries in order to function properly (Aside from spigot, obviously)

* [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) - Wrapper for the Discord API

* [Apache Commons lang3](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/) - Provides highly reusable static utility methods.

* [org.json](https://www.json.org/) - JSON is a light-weight, language independent, data interchange format.
